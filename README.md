# Project-supro FINI
Project-supro is a group project made by WeapWeap, Tariq Selawi and Hsia. It's a challenge asigned by BECODE LIEGE code training center. We had been working on this from 25/1/2021-2/2/2021 to learn about the teamworking pattern and consolidate our knowledges in the codes we've learned.

# The mission
Imagine:
We are a team of 3 (or 4) young freelancers developers who wish to have our first serious mission. For that, we create accounts on malt website and quickly we get in touch with John Lafrite, a web designer.

John works for a client called Supro. . Supro. is a company active in the fashion market. They would like to improve their presence on the web.

John Lafrite designed for them a website that meets their desires. But for the next step, he needs a team of developer to code the front-end and he would like to entrust this project to us !

The website is essentially an e-shop which presents the products company.

It composes by differents pages :

  * Homepage
  * Shop page
  * Single product page
  * About page
  * Contact page

Our mission is to build the front-end integration. John Lafrite provided the design but for the hover effects or fancy animations, we have to use our creativity of front-end developer.
